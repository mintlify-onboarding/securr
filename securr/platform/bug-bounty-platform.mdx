At Securr, we have built a security platform designed to help you build stable dApps using our on-chain vulnerability coordination and threat prevention tech. Our bug bounty platform is powered by the in-house RTTD (Real-Time Threat Detection) protocol, which instantly delivers critical and time-sensitive bugs submitted by security researchers to your dev team's communication channels for real-time resolution.

One of the key features of our bug bounty platform is our rapid triage service, which ensures that any vulnerabilities are quickly identified and addressed. We also offer a crowdsourced red team, made up of some of the best security researchers in the industry, to help find and resolve any issues.

Our bug bounty platform also offers one-click integration with popular communication tools like Slack, Discord, and Zoho, making it easy for your team to stay informed and coordinated. In addition, we offer an in-house smart contract auditing service to help you ensure the security of your smart contracts.

Automated bounty payments for hunters are also available, making it easy for security researchers to be rewarded for their efforts. These are just a few of the magic features we offer on our bug bounty platform.
