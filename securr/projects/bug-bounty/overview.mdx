We understand the importance of security in the web3 space, which is why we have built a comprehensive security platform that includes a bug bounty platform. Our bug bounty platform is designed to help companies build stable dApps using our on-chain vulnerability coordination and threat prevention technology.

One of the key features of our bug bounty platform is the in-house RTTD (Real-Time Threat Detection) protocol, which allows us to deliver critical and time-sensitive bugs submitted by security researchers instantly to your dev team's communication channels. This allows for real-time resolution of issues and helps to ensure that your dApps are as secure as possible.

In addition to the RTTD protocol, we offer a range of other features to help you keep your dApps secure, including:

- The best rapid triage service: Our team is made up of the best hunters in the web3 space, and we are equipped to handle any issue that arises.
- The best crowdsourced red team: Our crowdsourced red team consists of top security engineers who can help you identify and fix vulnerabilities in your dApps.
- One-click integration with popular tools: Our platform integrates seamlessly with popular tools such as Slack, Discord, and Zoho, making it easy to integrate into your existing workflow.
- Automated bounty payments: We offer automated bounty payments for hunters, making it easy for you to reward those who help keep your dApps secure.

Overall, our bug bounty platform is designed to help you build secure dApps and keep them that way, with a range of features that are designed to help you identify and fix vulnerabilities in real-time.
