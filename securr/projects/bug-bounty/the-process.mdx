We believe in making the process of launching a bug bounty program as simple and straightforward as possible. Here's a detailed overview of how our onboarding and launch process works:

1. First, clients fill out our onboarding form, which allows us to gather basic information about their project and bug bounty needs.

2. Next, we send a questionnaire to gather more in-depth information about the project, including the specific goals and objectives of the bug bounty program.

3. Using the answers to these questions, we draft up a customized bug bounty program that is tailored to the unique needs of the project.

4. The draft is then sent to the client for review and any necessary modifications. We encourage our clients to be as thorough as possible during this review process, as it helps ensure that the final bug bounty program is as effective as possible.

Our fees and payment process is also designed to be simple and transparent. We don't charge any upfront costs or maintenance fees, and we only charge a 10% performance fee on top of the bug bounty award when vulnerabilities are found. Projects are free to set their own payout amounts.

Overall, our goal is to make the bug bounty process as easy and stress-free as possible for our clients. If you have any questions about our onboarding and launch process or fees and payments, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
