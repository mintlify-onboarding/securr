Once you request an audit from Securr, here is the process you can expect:

1. [Companies fill out the form](https://tally.so/r/3EKEp2): To request an in-house smart contract audit, companies will fill out a form with information about their project. This form will provide us with high-level details about the project and help us understand the scope of the audit.

2. Contact within 48 hours: After a company submits the form, we will contact them within 48 hours to discuss the details of their project and provide a quote.

3. Deposit required: Before the audit can begin, a deposit of 40% is required. This helps to ensure that the project is committed to the audit process and allows us to allocate resources and assemble a team of auditors.

4. Audit pool created: Based on the experience level of our auditors, we will create an audit pool for the project. A Discord channel will also be set up for communication between the auditors and the project.

5. Kickoff meeting: The auditors and project will meet for a kickoff meeting, during which the lead auditors will be selected. This is an opportunity to clarify any details and establish a clear plan for the audit process.

6. The audit begins: The audit will begin with four auditors working independently. Once the audit is complete, they will receive a base payment and added bounties for any findings.

7. Cross-validation and preliminary report: All findings will be cross-validated with the four auditors and one independent reviewer. A preliminary report will be drafted, and the Securr team and all the auditors will meet to discuss the findings.

8. Time for codebase improvement: The project will be given time to improve the codebase, and will have two weeks from receipt of the preliminary report to make final payments.
