title: "‚è± During the Audit"
---

During an in-house smart contract audit begins at Securr, the following steps are taken to ensure that the process is thorough and efficient:

1. Virtual kickoff meeting: A virtual meeting is held between the project team and the auditing team to discuss the details of the project and establish a clear plan for the audit process. This is an opportunity to clarify any questions or concerns and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

2. Lead auditor chosen: Based on their abilities and expertise, the lead auditor for the audit pool is selected. This auditor will be responsible for overseeing the audit process and ensuring that all findings are properly documented and reported.

3. Automated audits: The codebase is subjected to automated audits by the auditors. This helps to identify any potential issues or vulnerabilities that may have been missed during the manual audit process.

4. Manual audits: The auditors work independently to manually audit the code, looking for any issues or vulnerabilities that may not have been detected during the automated audits.

5. Issue reporting: Any issues discovered during the manual audits are reported by the auditors on a private GitHub repository. This helps to keep track of all findings and allows the project team to address them in a timely manner.

6. Auditor discussion: The auditors meet to discuss their findings and ensure that all issues have been properly documented and reported.

7. Preliminary report: The lead auditor compiles all findings into a preliminary report, which is reviewed by the Securr team before being sent to the project team.

8. Project Response: The project team addresses any unresolved concerns raised by the auditors, and the auditors confirm that the revision did not introduce any new problems.

9. Final report: The final report prepared by the lead auditor is reviewed by Securr before being delivered to the project team. This report includes all findings and recommendations for improvement.
